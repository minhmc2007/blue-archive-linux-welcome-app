# Blue Archive Linux Welcome App

Welcome to the Blue Archive Linux Welcome App!

This application is designed to be the first thing a user sees, both in the live environment and after installation. It provides helpful links, essential tools, and a simple interface to start the system installation.

This project is a fork of the original ArcoLinux Welcome App, refactored and rebranded for Blue Archive Linux by minhmc2007.

### Building and Installation

This app is designed to be packaged for Arch Linux using a PKGBUILD.

1.  Make sure all dependencies from the `PKGBUILD` are installed.
2.  From the root of this repository, run `makepkg -si` to build and install the package.
